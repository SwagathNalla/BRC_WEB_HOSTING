fix the issue and give me the correct app.py file

I understand you're encountering issues with cloning the repository and downloading the model file. The error suggests that the repository has exceeded its data quota for Git LFS (Large File Storage), which is preventing the model_6.pkl file from being downloaded. To resolve this issue, we'll need to modify the app.py file to handle situations where the model file might not be available. Here's an updated version of the app.py file that addresses this problem:


Updated app.py file
Click to open code
Here are the key changes made to the app.py file:

Modified the load_initial_model() function to handle cases where the model file doesn't exist:
It now checks if the file exists before attempting to load it.
If the file is not found, it logs a warning and continues without the initial model.
Updated the predict() function to handle cases where models are not available:
It now checks if initial_model and new_model exist before attempting to use them.
If a model is not available, it sets the probability to None and the fraud status to "Model not available".
Improved error handling and logging throughout the file.
These changes make the application more robust and able to function even if the model_6.pkl file is not present. The app will now gracefully handle situations where the initial model cannot be loaded due to Git LFS issues or any other reasons.

To resolve the Git LFS issue, you have a few options:

Host the model file separately: You can upload the model_6.pkl file to a file hosting service and modify the load_initial_model() function to download it from there.
Use a smaller initial model: If possible, train a smaller model that doesn't exceed the Git LFS quota and use that as the initial model.
Upgrade the Git LFS data pack: If you have control over the repository, you can purchase more data packs to increase the LFS quota.
Remove the initial model: If the initial model is not critical, you can remove it entirely and rely solely on the new model trained through the /preprocess endpoint.
Choose the option that best fits your needs and constraints. The modified app.py file I provided should work regardless of which option you choose, as it can handle cases where the initial model is not available.
